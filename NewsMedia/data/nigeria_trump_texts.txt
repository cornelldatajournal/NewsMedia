Trump, meanwhile, campaigned in Michigan and Pennsylvania, telling supporters he would win a landslide-type election and a total victory.

 Joe Biden unleashed on Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk during a campaign event in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. The US president tore into the Republican candidate, calling him a “loser” while claiming that the Tesla CEO was an “illegal worker” when he first began his career in the United States. During his fiery speech, Biden took aim at the GOP presidential nominee, arguing that he does not care about the welfare of union workers. The president even suggested should Trump win the November election, he would do away with health care and pension benefits, reported Fox News. “Donald Trump is a loser. He’s a loser of a candidate, and he’s a loser of a man,” Biden said while addressing the crowd at a campaign rally for Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz. “I’ve never been this direct,” he went on, adding, “But I tell you what, [Trump] is about making sure you push people down. He thinks the way you get ahead is to push people down.” Biden continued to criticise Trump, claiming that we would “take away all the things we’ve [Democrats] done.” Asserting that the “last thing” America needs is for the former president to get reelected, he asked the crowd, “How many of you have pensions now? How many of your families have pensions?” before stating that Trump “opposes it.” After bashing Trump, Biden shifted his focus to Musk in an indirect swipe. “Turns out the wealthiest man in the world, now [Trump’s] ally, was an illegal worker here,” he said, adding, “He [Musk] was supposed to be in school when he came on a student visa. He wasn’t in school. He was violating the law. He’s talking about all these ‘illegals’ coming our way.”  Prev Post				 Mbappe Blasted As ‘Biggest Culprit’ After Barcelona Humble Real Madrid In El Clasico Next Post  Lions Club District 404B2 Takes Medical Mission To Agege Schools, Plants Trees In Another Your email address will not be published.

   Date (MENAFN- Live Mint) Elon Musk, the tech billionaire, reportedly 'worked illegally' in the United States back in the 1990s as he ventured to build a startup company. The US news daily 'The Washington Post' in a report on Saturday said the Tesla owner and SpaceX CEO arrived in California's Palo Alto in 1995 to pursue higher studies in Stanford University.However, the South African-born billionaire businessman never graduated the program he enrolled for, The Washington Post reported citing court records and company document. According to the news outlet's report, Elon Musk instead developed a software company Zip2.  Also Read  | Elon Musk-Putin's 'secret talks' concerns NASA boss: 'If the story is true...' The Tesla chief reportedly received US work authorisation somewhere around 1997. However, his freewheeling business could become a subject of scrutiny had he attempted to go public. Consequently, Elon Musk sold his first entrepreneurial venture in 1999 for around $300 million.This marked Tesla Chief's steppingstone to grand ventures that enabled him to become the world's wealthiest person in the world. Undoubtedly, Elon Musk scripted history and his success is a testimony to America's population of triumphant immigrants.

Supporting Republican candidates' claims that“open borders” and undocumented immigrants are destroying America, Elon Musk's X has been extensively and intensively broadcasting those views to more than 200 million followers on the social media platform.

 As the American general elections approach on November 5, the polit­ical environment is as turbulent as ever. The race for the White House has taken on an unpredictable turn, dominat­ed by polarizing debates, media bias, and unprecedented events that are shifting public opinion in ways never seen before. One of the most striking as­pects of this election is the num­ber of assassination attempts that Donald Trump has faced— three in total by recent investiga­tions. These attempts underscore the intensity of the forces against him, as many perceive his rise as a threat to entrenched political structures. Trump’s anti-estab­lishment stance, which gained him a formidable following in 2016, has only deepened the di­vide between his supporters and opponents. Meanwhile, the Democratic Party, led by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Har­ris, is struggling to maintain a unified message. Harris’ stance on issues such as abortion and LGBTQ+ rights has become a flashpoint. On abortion, Harris has consistently advocated for a woman’s right to choose, which aligns with Democratic values, but this position remains divi­sive. Many conservative voters see this as part of a broader cultural shift that distances the country from its traditional val­ues. On LGBTQ+ issues, Harris has stood firm, promoting equal­ity and inclusion, but these stanc­es have become hot-button issues for those advocating for religious freedoms and conservative poli­cies. I am informed also that she’s advocating for the removal of the word ‘God’ in the enshrined con­stitution of the USA. Adding to the volatile mix is the media’s role in shaping the narrative of the elections. Trump has always had a combative re­lationship with mainstream me­dia outlets like CNN and other pro-Democrat media networks, which have continued their re­lentless critique of his policies, character, and handling of the presidency. These negative re­ports, however, have done little to dampen the enthusiasm of his base, who see these attacks as part of a coordinated attempt to tarnish his image. In fact, for many of his supporters, these media campaigns only reinforce their belief that Trump is the one leader willing to stand against the tide of biased coverage. The international scene is equally chaotic. The ongoing Is­raeli-Palestinian conflict, with the added threat from Hezbollah, is a stark reminder of the fragile state of global peace. The Middle East remains a flashpoint for terrorism and war, with no clear solution in sight. Under Biden’s administration, critics argue that American influence has waned in the region, with Israel feeling increasingly isolated and vulner­able. Trump, on the other hand, has long positioned himself as a dealmaker capable of bringing peace to the Middle East. His ad­ministration’s efforts to broker peace agreements between Israel and several Arab nations during his first term stand as evidence of his capacity to navigate com­plex diplomatic waters. A recent conversation with a childhood friend of mine, a Ni­gerian-American who now lives in the U.S. and who is among the early voters for Trump, added a personal angle to my understand­ing of Trump’s appeal. He argued passionately that Trump is the only leader who can re-order the world if given another chance. “Trump’s approach may be un­conventional, but he’s a strong leader, and that’s what the world needs right now,” he said, refer­ring to Trump’s foreign policies and economic strategies. He emphasized that Trump would not just focus on making Amer­ica stronger, but that his leader­ship would create a ripple effect across the globe, forcing nations to re-evaluate their alliances and trade partnerships in a way that would lead to more stability. “Trump understands how to negotiate from a position of strength,” my friend contin­ued, “and that’s what it takes to bring peace in today’s world. He doesn’t back down to threats. Look at North Korea, look at the Middle East—he made progress where others failed.” For him, Trump’s ability to challenge the global order was not a threat, but a necessary move to make last­ing changes. “He’s willing to do what it takes, even if it means shaking things up. That’s how peace is made in the long run,” he concluded. Hearing this from someone who had experienced life both in Nigeria and the U.S., and who had been a part of both political systems, gave me a deeper insight into why Trump’s leadership still resonates with so many, even those living outside the U.S. Benefits of a Trump Presidency for Nigeria For Nigeria, a Trump presiden­cy could offer several benefits, particularly in the realm of elec­toral transparency and fairness. One cannot forget how, during President Obama’s administra­tion, Nigeria was pressured into a political change that has had lasting effects. In 2015, Obama played a crucial role in ensuring that then-President Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat to Muhammadu Buhari, ushering in an era that many Nigerians now look back on as harrowing. Buhari’s eight years in power have been marked by economic decline, security challenges, and widespread dissatisfaction. The pressure from the Obama admin­istration left Nigeria with a gov­ernment that many argue was not equipped to lead the country into a more prosperous future. Furthermore, under Biden’s administration, Nigeria has wit­nessed a frustrating lack of trans­parency concerning the political rise of Bola Tinubu, the current president. Despite numerous questions surrounding Tinubu’s background and qualifications, the Biden administration has not taken any decisive steps to push for clarity. This inaction has al­lowed a lack of accountability to fester, with many Nigerians feel­ing that their voices have been drowned out by the global powers at play. A Trump presidency, however, would likely bring a different ap­proach. Trump has demonstrated a willingness to challenge global institutions and insist on fairness and transparency. For Nigeria, this could mean a presidency that does not tolerate election rigging, corruption, or manipu­lation by external forces. Trump’s insistence on “America First” policies may extend to demand­ing that other nations, including Nigeria, adhere to principles of equity, fairness, and probity in their elections. Moreover, Trump’s track record shows that he is not afraid to ques­tion the status quo, which could lead to more international pres­sure on African leaders to uphold democratic values. Unlike Biden, Trump’s administration might not turn a blind eye to electoral irregularities or refuse to address concerns about leaders like Tinu­bu. Instead, Trump’s presidency would likely advocate for a more transparent, accountable, and just political system in Nigeria, fostering a democracy where the people’s voices truly matter. As November 5 draws clos­er, one cannot help but feel that the political winds are blowing toward a Trump resurgence. De­spite the controversies surround­ing him, Trump has shown an un­shakable resilience. His message of putting “America First,” his promises of a stronger economy, and his ability to challenge the status quo resonate deeply with a large portion of the American electorate. In a world fraught with conflict, media manipulation, and social division, many believe that only a Donald Trump presidency can re­store a sense of order. Whether it is reining in the influence of a bi­ased media, addressing America’s cultural and moral dilemmas, or brokering peace in conflict zones, Trump’s unorthodox approach may be exactly what is needed to steer the world back toward peace and tranquility. As the final votes are cast on November 5, it’s looking Donald Trumpish. And for his support­ers, that’s exactly the outcome they are hoping for.
